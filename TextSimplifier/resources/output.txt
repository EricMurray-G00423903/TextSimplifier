Once upon a time , in a little town nestled between track hills , there living a young girl named Clara .
She loved create the woods near her home , where light streamed through the trees , and the sound of birds room the air .
Clara ago her days collecting wildflowers , skipping stones along the lake , and imagining stories about the animals she when .
One day , while kids deeper into the park than usually , she stumbled upon an old , abandoned log .
Curious , she pushed open the creaking window and after into .
What she found would change her life love .
