Once upon a time, in a quiet village nestled between rolling hills, there lived a young girl named Clara.
She loved exploring the woods near her home, where sunlight streamed through the trees, and the sound of birds filled the air.
Clara spent her days collecting wildflowers, skipping stones across the creek, and imagining stories about the animals she saw.
One day, while wandering deeper into the forest than usual, she stumbled upon an old, abandoned cabin.
Curious, she pushed open the creaking door and stepped inside.
What she found would change her life forever.
